## FLASHCARDS

This is a personal project in which i create a simple implementation of a flashcards program, i've created this in order to have a simple tool that helps me study.

It consists of 2 main choices, in which you can create or read a file, in which you will store your flashcards.

The files will be created and/or read in csv format.

You also have 2 methods of using them:

	* quiz like structure, in which you do not know if your answer is correct until you finish the flashcards, you will be graded on a scale of 0-10.
 
	* study session, in which you are given the question of the flashcards and you answer, it will tell you whether you are correct or not, you have an option to skip the question.
